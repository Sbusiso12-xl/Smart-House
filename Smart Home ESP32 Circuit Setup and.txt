Smart Home ESP32 Circuit Setup and Testing Report

1. INITIAL CONNECTIONS

This section outlines the process of setting up the ESP32 circuit on a breadboard for initial testing using four LEDs.

- Begin by inserting the ESP32 development board into the breadboard. Ensure that all pins are accessible for wiring.
- Connect the VCC pin of the ESP32 to the breadboard's power rail.
- Connect the GND pin to the ground rail.
- Select GPIO output pins that are physically close together to keep the wiring neat and traceable.

  The following GPIO pins were used:
    - GPIO 12: Bedroom Light
    - GPIO 13: Kitchen Light
    - GPIO 26: Bedroom Plug 1
    - GPIO 25: Bedroom Plug 2
    - GPIO 33: Kitchen Plug 1
    - GPIO 32: Kitchen Plug 2

- For testing purposes, LEDs were connected to each of the GPIO pins above to verify signal output.

Note: A short video demonstration has been included in the folder named "FIGURE 1" as proof of successful testing.

2. RELAY MODULE CONNECTIONS

After completing the breadboard test using LEDs, the next step involved connecting the ESP32 to relay modules that control actual appliances.

- The ESP32 was powered using a standard phone charger.
- The relay modules were also powered using the ESP32â€™s output power; however, for reliability, it is recommended to power the ESP32 and relays separately.

Connections:
  - Connect ESP32 VCC to the VCC of the relay module.
  - Connect ESP32 GND to the relay module GND.
  - Reconnect each wire from the tested GPIO pins to the input (signal) pin of the corresponding relay channel.

Each relay controls a different appliance based on the GPIO pin it is connected to.

3. USER DEVICE INTERACTION

- On a smartphone or other device, open a browser and enter the IP address displayed in the serial monitor after uploading and running the ESP32 code.
- A control panel interface will load in the browser.
- Use the control panel to send commands to the ESP32.
- The ESP32 will respond by activating the corresponding relay, which in turn controls the connected appliance.
